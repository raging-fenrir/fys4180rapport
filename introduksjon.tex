\subsection {Introduction}
  The Mach-Zendher interferometer was first proposed in 1891 by Ludwig Zendher
  \cite{lz} and later on refined by Ludwig Mach\cite{lm}.
  In the later years it has been used for understanding the kinetics of dense
  fluid transport properties\cite{th,dym}.
  Within high pressure experiments a classical showcase of agreement between
  experimental data and theory is the selfdiffusion data of methane\cite{ht,ew}.
  What we want to find out is how accurate this setup can be and what might be
  done with it to increase that accuracy.
  Exactly this interferometer were used by D. K. Dysthe in 1995 to measure
  NaCl/water and 1-butanol/water. It was then found to have a precision
  of 0.6\% for NaCl and 1.4\% for 1-butanol\cite{dag}.
