\subsection {Introduction}
  The Mach-Zendher interferometer was first proposed in 1891 by Ludwig Zendher
  \cite{lz} and later on refined by Ludwig Mach\cite{lm}.
  In the later years it has been used for understanding the kinetics of dense
  fluid transport properties\cite{th,dym}.

  Exactly this interferometer were used by D. K. Dysthe in 1995 to measure
  NaCl/water and 1-butanol/water. It was then found to have a precision
  of 0.6\% for NaCl and 1.4\% for 1-butanol\cite{dag}.
