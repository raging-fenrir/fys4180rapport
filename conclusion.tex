\section {Conclusion}
The diffusion experiment gave a pointer to that this setup can be used at high
precision measurements down to the order of 100 nm. And the calcit test showed
that the are limitations to the camera and the unwrapping algorithm used.
Since the canals only became 2 pixel wide the unwrapping did not give any meaningful
results. Beacuse this is a Mach-Zendher interferomter the different components
are highly felxible in their positions and thus could be set up in a way so that
the canals in the calcit sample took more room on the camera chip. The way forth 
would be to get the components closer together by using a breadboard so each component
can be moved to each specific experiment, use a higher resolution camera to get more
pixels per size of sample we are looking at
