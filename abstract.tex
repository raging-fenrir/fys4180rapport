\section {Abstract}
  Mach-Zendher interferomter with phase shift used on diffusion and erosion in
  water. This interferomter have a higher resolution than the Michelson interferometer
  and gives a better picture of microfluidic devices. In this article it was tested
  on table salt diffused in water and erosion of calcit with running water.
  The diffusion was a test to see if the equipment still worked and that all the
  pieces could cooperate, and the calcite were to give an estimate of the precision
  of the equipment. The erosion showed that the setup that was used did not have 
  enough resolution to get the full effect of the Mach-Zendher interferometer.
