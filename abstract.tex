\section {Abstract}
  Mach-Zendher interferomter with phase shift used on diffusion of table salt and 
  erosion of calcit in water. This interferomter have a higher resolution than the 
  Michelson interferometer and gives a better picture of microfluidic devices. It 
  also have more flexible components. In this report it was tested
  on table salt diffused in water and erosion of calcit with running water.
  The diffusion was a test to see if the equipment still worked and that all the
  pieces could cooperate, and the calcit were to give an estimate of the precision
  of the equipment. The erosion showed that the setup that was used did not have 
  enough resolution to get the full effect of the Mach-Zendher interferometer.
